# rogue-guy

A simple [Roguelike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roguelike) game.  Used as my own play area for learning the Rust programming language.

Code reader be warned.  This project contains rough and unsightly code.  It is subject to my own whim and musings as I journey through the learning process of the Rust language.  It is not to be taken seriously.
