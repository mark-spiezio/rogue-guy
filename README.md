# rogue-guy

A simple [Roguelike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roguelike) game.  Used as my own play area for learning the Rust programming language.  This is my take on the [Roguelike Tutorial in Rust + tcod](https://tomassedovic.github.io/roguelike-tutorial/index.html).

Code reader be warned.  This project contains rough and unsightly code.  It is subject to my own whim and musings as I journey through the learning process of the Rust language.  It is not to be taken seriously.
